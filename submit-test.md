## Abstract

This SIP proposes establishing a Stacks Endowment funded over five years to accelerate ecosystem growth, integrations, and incentives with minimal changes to overall inflation while preserving network sustainability.

## Introduction

As Stacks adoption and sBTC TVL expand, scalable resources are required to support builders, integrations, and protocol improvements. This SIP outlines goals, rationale, and governance for an endowment-driven growth round.

## Problem Statement

Current funding pathways are fragmented and not sized for the scope of opportunities ahead (DeFi incentives, integrations, growth). Without a coordinated, multi-year plan, momentum and key initiatives may be under-resourced.

## Proposed Solution

Create a time-bound Endowment with transparent governance to fund growth priorities: marketing, integrations, DeFi/user incentives, developer and founder programs, and operational support. Keep inflation below top-50 median and publish audited reporting.

# Specification

### Endowment Structure
- Duration: 5 years
- Target Size: 500M STX distributed over program period
- Governance: Appointments Committee -> Treasury Committee; public reporting

### Use of Funds (non-exhaustive)
- Ecosystem incentives (DeFi, user growth)
- Integrations and exchange support
- Builder grants, founder programs, security initiatives
- Marketing and ecosystem operations

### Reporting
- Quarterly public reporting, dashboards, and audits

# Related Work

- SIP-007 (Stacking Consensus)
- SIP-021 (Nakamoto Upgrade)
- sBTC design principles and ecosystem growth plans

# Backwards Compatibility

Economic changes are forward-looking; no breaking changes to existing smart contracts. Node operators require only routine upgrade procedures.

# Activation

#### Voting
- Snapshot voting for liquid STX; Stacking voting for locked STX
- Thresholds defined by CAB guidance; results independently reviewed

#### Timeline
- Hard fork height: to be announced with final binaries and upgrade docs
