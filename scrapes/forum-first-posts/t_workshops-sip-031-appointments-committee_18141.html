<div class="row"><div class="topic-body clearfix"><div class="regular contents"><div class="cooked"><p>Hey Stackers, as you may have been previewed on today’s Spaces with DeOrganized Media, we’re putting forward a process to establish the nominations for the Appointments Committee for SIP-031. In short, we plan to facilitate a short series of special sessions. The structure we’re outlining below will allow for wide-ranging input while also moving fast as the SIP progresses (see the <a href="https://stx.is/growth-sip">latest version here</a>). The goal of these sessions is to produce a list of members for the Treasury Appointments Committee to include in the SIP, which will then be voted on by the community.</p>
<p>As a reminder from the SIP, the Treasury Appointments Committee will be responsible for selecting the Treasury Committee for the Endowment, which is responsible for allocating funding to ecosystem contributors and builders.</p>
<p>To establish the Treasury Appointment Committee, we start by hosting a 2-part workshop, with possible additional sessions as needed. For those wishing to participate async, full notes will be posted on the forum below this, but please note that the real-time discussion will be the primary decision driver. There is more about why this approach is important below. <img src="https://forum.stacks.org/images/emoji/twitter/pray.png?v=12" title=":pray:" class="emoji" alt=":pray:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

<a name="sessions-1" class="anchor" href="#sessions-1"></a>Sessions:</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.addevent.com/event/Ku25900023"><strong>Session 1: June 10 from 10am ET to 11:30 ET</strong></a></p>
<p>Ahead of the first session, the Stacks Foundation will provide a <strong>draft</strong> starting point for the qualifications the community may want to impose on nominees, as well as an initial list of possible nominees collected over the past couple weeks on Spaces and social media. This first session will seek to dial in these qualifications, driving rough consensus around what we, as a community, agree we want to see from anyone selected to serve in this capacity. The first session will also review possible parameters for the overall ‘mix’ of members, establishing how we will ensure accurate representation throughout the community.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.addevent.com/event/vA25924569"><strong>Session 2: June 13 from 10am ET to 11:30 ET</strong></a></p>
<p>During this session, we will debate specific nominations according to the previously established parameters with the ultimate goal of producing the list of members for the Treasury Appointment Committee. This list will be produced with the framework established in Session 1 as to what the makeup of the committee should be, at top of mind.</p>
<p><strong>Session 2.x: June 12</strong></p>
<p>Exact date and time to be determined, but I will host an additional session on opposite timezones on this same day for any of those not able to join the main discussion. We’ve optimized for the timezone that generally works best for the most, but understand that’s not ideal for all and would love to make this time convenient for those folks.</p>
<p><strong>Session 3: TBD</strong></p>
<p>This session will immediately follow the second if there is remaining debate about the list of members established through Sessions 1 and 2.</p>

<a name="process-rationale-2" class="anchor" href="#process-rationale-2"></a><strong>Process rationale:</strong>
</h3>
<p>We’ve seen time and again in the community that real-time conversation enables us to quickly work through complex issues and ensure people are heard. Through synchronous discussions, we can hear nuanced takes, quickly clarify misunderstandings, and most rapidly drive consensus. With that in mind, what I’ve outlined looks very much like an accelerated version of the process we ran for the Stacks Roadmap, which provided space for effective discussion, representation, and resulted in a roadmap that has been widely well-received. If you squint, you could even think of this like a special CAB of sorts, borrowing elements from the SIP model that has worked well over many years.</p>
<p>Other benefits of this design:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduces reactive commentary, making space for open, intellectually honest conversations and the kind of thoughtful discussion or debate that can genuinely shift perspectives.</li>
<li>Allows for nominees and others to speak to any critiques in real-time and make their own case in a human way</li>
<li>Forces a deeper level of engagement with the content and discussion than is typically possible on social media, which this deserves</li>
<li>Reduces surface-level input and ensures that those who take the time are leading the discussions (and we appreciate it, everyone’s time is stretched thin!).</li>
<li>Allows for wide-ranging input in a timely manner</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Register <a href="https://www.addevent.com/event/Ku25900023">here</a></strong> to receive a calendar invite to the first session and prep materials. We will be using Zoom so that everyone can easily chat and to avoid the frequent ruggings Spaces seems to be doing to us lately. <img src="https://forum.stacks.org/images/emoji/twitter/joy.png?v=12" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>All those who register will receive the aforementioned starting resources in advance of the sessions and will be expected to review the material before the session. We’re looking forward to seeing you there! Please be sure to spread the word to any potential nominee that they may want to join a session.</p></div></div></div></div>
