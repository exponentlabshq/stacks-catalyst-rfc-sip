<p>I would like to propose an enhancement to the SIP-010 fungible token standard by including a native burn function. While Clarity provides the <code>ft-burn?</code> function, this is not currently required in the SIP-010 trait. As a result, developers often rely on sending tokens to the zero address, which doesn’t truly reduce the circulating supply but just locks the tokens.</p>
<p>Here’s why adding a burn function would be beneficial:</p>
<ol>
<li>Supply Control<br>
Burning tokens would provide a clear, permanent reduction in supply, helping control inflation and improve market stability.</li>
<li>Encouraging Deflationary Models<br>
A standard burn function would simplify the creation of deflationary tokens, making them more attractive to long-term holders by naturally increasing scarcity.</li>
<li>Transparency and Trust<br>
On-chain burn events would be verifiable and final, ensuring transparency in token supply management and increasing trust within token economies.</li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, adding this feature would simplify development, encourage healthier tokenomics, and provide transparency in managing token supply. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this proposal.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
