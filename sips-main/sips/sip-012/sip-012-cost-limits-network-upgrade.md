# Abstract

The Stacks 2.0 blockchain artificially constrains block goodput in two
consensus-critical ways: it assesses storage costs for lists based on their
maximum length instead of actual length, and it constrains the number of indexed
I/O operations well below what the reference implementation is capable of
handling.  Changing either of these is breaking change, which requires a
network-wide upgrade.

This SIP proposes executing a breaking change to not only
address these two constraints, but also to update all Clarity cost functions to
more accurately reflect their true performance.  The breaking change is carried
out via a network-wide vote by Stackers on the Bitcoin blockchain, which will
both serve to activate this SIP and to effectively bypass the cost voting procedure
in SIP-006.

The upgraded blockchain will be called Stacks 2.05.

# Introduction

The current block limits were set very conservatively in Stacks 2.0, but
since the mainnet launch on 2021-01-14, traffic on the network has grown
steadily.  In recent months, we have seen network congestion adversely
impacting the user experience: valid transactions are not
getting mined in a timely manner because there is far more demand for block compute
capacity than supply.  For example, in Stacks blocks from height 27,672 through 28,573, 675
blocks' highest-filled compute dimension was their `runtime` dimension, but 319
blocks' highest-filled compute dimension was their `read_count` dimension ([full
report](./SIP-012-001.ods)).  In another study of 455 Stacks blocks between height
30,904 and 33,002, just over 14% of them exceeded the `read_count` dimension
and just over 85% exceeded the `runtime` dimension ([full report](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/discussions/2883)).

While there will likely always be more demand than supply for block compute
capacity, the current supply is artifically limited in three principal ways:

* At the time of the launch, the MARF index (see SIP-004) was implemented in
  such a way that a block could only execute 7,500 MARF index reads and writes
while being processed by a non-mining node on consumer hardware in a reasonable
amount of time.  This number was arrived at by measuring how many MARF reads and writes
could be completed on a consumer laptop in 10 seconds in 2019.  But because the block limit is a
consensus-critical constant that all Stacks nodes must agree on, increasing the
number of MARF reads and writes per block can only be done via a breaking
change.  This means that any improvements to the MARF's performance that could
permit significant increase in the number of operations per block can only
be capitalized upon via a breaking change.

* An emerging Clarity contract design pattern is to store data maps and data
  variables comprised of lists with a large maximum length.  The reason
for this, we suspect, is because it permits storing a lot of MARF-indexed data with
few MARF reads and writes.  However, the Clarity VM assesses list storage based
on its _maximum_ length, not the length of the data stored.  Assessing storage
based on the length of the data would allow contracts to make better use of the
`read_length` and `write_length` compute resources (which have been hit in
practice), but this would require a breaking change.

* Most of the cost functions in SIP-006 have constants that are far too
  conservative in practice.  The numbers used when mainnet launched were chosen
to minimize the risk of a network-wide denial-of-service arising from producing
blocks that would take an inordinate amount of time to validate; they were not
chosen through a rigorous benchmarking process.  In the months since then,
we have developed a more rigorous 
[benchmark suite](https://github.com/blockstack/clarity-benchmarking)
for the Clarity VM implementation, and have arrived at more accurate runtime
constants for the cost functions that permit suitable block validation times on contemporary
hardware.  The new limits, listed in [Appendix A](#appendix-a), 
would vastly increase the number of Clarity functions that can be
executed per block.  But in order to capitalize on this new data, STX token holders would
need to execute the SIP-006 cost voting protocol to activate new cost functions.

This SIP proposes a **breaking change** that would address these first two
limitations.  It would increase the block runtime `read_count` and `write_count`
limits by a factor of 2, in order to allow the network to capitalize on a [recent MARF performance
improvement](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/issues/2869).  It
would also change storage cost assessment for list data to consider the length
of the value being stored, instead of its maximum length.  In addition, this 
would bypass the voting protocol in SIP-006 to set 
[new proposed runtime cost functions parameters](https://forum.stacks.org/t/more-accurate-cost-functions-for-clarity-native-functions/12386)
via a voting protocol described in this SIP.

## A Note on Bypassing SIP-006

This SIP explicitly bypasses the voting procedure in SIP-006 by means of a separate
voting procedure described below.  However, this SIP does not supersede SIP-006,
nor does it set a precedent for this particular voting procedure's general
applicability to making collective decisions in the SIP process.  The voting
procedure in this SIP is specific to this SIP, and is only meant to activate the
changes described in this SIP.

The reason for this accommodation is that the SIP-006 voting procedure may be
too costly to use in practice, since STX holders must forego Stacking to use it.
A future SIP may study this problem further, and propose a new voting procedure 
for runtime costs in recognition of this.  However, that is not the subject of
this SIP.

# Specification

## Activation Protocol

In the text below, "Stacks 2.05" refers to the proposed network-upgrade for
cost-limits.

Due to the far-reaching effects a breaking change will have on the Stacks
ecosystem, this SIP can only be activated through a collective decision-making
process.  There are three major steps to this activation procedure:

   1.  The SIP authors will propose a Bitcoin block number at which the new cost-limits
   take effect. The block number should be at least two calendar weeks from when
   this SIP transitions into _Recommended_ status, so as to provide sufficient time for
   node operators to upgrade. Tentatively this block number would be chosen to fall
   on November 29th or November 30th, 2021.  In this document, this is the
**activation block**.

   On November 15, 2021, the SIP authors finalized the choice of Bitcoin block
713,000 to be the activation block.  This block is expected to be mined at or
around December 6, 2021.  The reason for this extra week delay over the
tentative block number is to ensure that the network upgrade happens in the
_middle_ of a reward cycle.  November 29th/30th is expected to be the start of
reward cycle 21. Executing a network upgrade at the start of a reward cycle is
needlessly risky, because if the upgrade fails for some reason during the
prepare phase, it could cause PoX rewards to be disabled for cycle 21.

   2.  In the two whole reward cycles prior to the activation block, users who
       have Stacked STX will have the opportunity to cast a vote to activate
this SIP.  The cut-off for voting will be a _separate_ Bitcoin block whose
expected arrival time is one calendar week prior to the activation block.  This
document refers to this block as the **vote deadline block.**

   On November 15, 2021, the SIP authors finalized the decision to select the
first Bitcoin block height mined after November 23, 2021 at 12:00 EST to be the
vote deadline block.  This was Bitcoin block 710,001.

   3.  If the activation voting threshold is met as of the vote deadline block,
then the Stacks Foundation will make a release of the Stacks blockchain
reference implementation with this
SIP's changes applied and set to take effect once the activation block passes.
If on the other hand there is insufficient support for this SIP by the vote
deadline block, then no action will be taken and this SIP will not activate.
   
   On November 23, 2021, the SIP authors inspected the Bitcoin and Stacks chainstate
using [vote-tallying scripts](./scripts) and determined that the the voting threshold has been met.
At least 129,615,879 stacked STX had voted in favor of this SIP, and 0 against.

To activate this SIP, users who have Stacked STX in either of the last two whole
reward cycles prior to the vote deadline block height will have the opportunity to
vote with their STX by sending a minimial amount of BTC to one of two addresses.
There will be two Bitcoin addresses whose UTXOs will be used to tally the
vote: a "yes" address, and a "no" address.

* The "yes" address will be a p2pkh Bitcoin address whose inner Hash160 is
  `00000000000000000000000000000000000000ee`.  On mainnet, this is address
`111111111111111111112czxoHN`.

* The "no" address will be a separate p2pkh Bitcoin address whose inner Hash160
  is `00000000000000000000000000000000000000ff`.  On mainnet, this is address
`111111111111111111112kmzDG2`.

Note that these are similar addresses to the PoX burn address, but they all
differ from one another in their checksums.

Vote tallying is performed by examining how many STX the Bitcoin transaction
sender has most-recently Stacked.  By examining the UTXOs for these two Bitcoin
addresses, anyone with a full copy of the Stacks chain state as of the voting
deadline will be able to calculate how many recently-Stacked STX have signaled
"yes" or "no" support for this SIP.

To match the Bitcoin transaction to the Stacker's state in the `.pox` contract,
the `scriptSig` of the first transaction input must be signed by either the user's PoX reward
address's public key(s), or the public key(s) of the standard principal Stacks address that Stacked
the tokens (the option is provided here because not all Stackers have access to their PoX
addresses).  In either case, the vote commits the Stacker's
most-recently-locked STX to "yes" or "no" if the Stacker had some STX locked
in the past two reward cycles as of the vote deadline block.

For Stackers that vote with their Stacks address key(s), the STX that the
associated standard principal had locked up will be committed to the vote.

For Stackers that vote with their PoX address key(s), the STX for _all_
associated Stacks principals that use this PoX address will be committed to the
vote (note that multiple Stacks principals may use the same PoX address).

For Stackers that have delegated STX to a Stacking pool, the pool operator must
perform the vote on their behalf.  As with a normal Stacker, the pool operator may 
sign the Bitcoin transaction with either the PoX reward address key(s) or the
standard Stacks principal address key(s).

For Stackers that have Stacked via a smart contract, only the PoX reward
address key(s) may be used to vote.

Stackers can send as many Bitcoin transactions as they like, but their STX will
only be counted once.  Only the *first* such voting transaction will be
considered to determine how the STX voted.

If a Stacker votes using both their STX address and PoX address, then the PoX
address will be used to count their STX.  A subsequent vote with the STX address
will be ignored as a duplicate vote.  In particular, the PoX address will
count *all* STX it represents.  For example, if Alice Stacks 100,000 STX with two STX
addresses that share the same PoX address, and she votes with her PoX address,
then the vote will count for 200,000 STX, and she will be unable to vote
separately with her STX addresses.  If instead she votes with only one
of her STX addresses, then that vote counts for 100,000 STX.

If a Stacker votes for both "yes" and "no," their vote will not be counted at
all.  This provides a way for a Stacker to cancel their vote, but they will be
unable to change it.

### Activation Criteria 

The SIP will be considered _Ratified_ if the vote to activate Stacks 2.05
passes. This requires:

* 2/3 of all votes passed are "yes", weighted by the STX they represent, at a
  Bitcoin block height at or before the vote deadline block.

* At least 60 million STX are represented by the "yes" votes. This is 2x the
  largest Stacker at the time of this writing.

### Rationale 

The rationale for this voting procedure is that it simultaneously gives the
community a way to veto the SIP while also accommodating low turnout. The
problem with blockchain-based voting systems in the past is that unless
there is a financial incentive to vote (e.g. mining, staking), turnout is low.
For example, the Ethereum carbon vote [1] to disable the DAO smart contract had only
5.5% turnout [2].  As another example, BitShares' [3] highest-voted delegate in its
delegated proof-of-stake consensus algorithm only received 18% of the vote [4].

This SIP's activation procedure takes the position that non-voters are passive
system participants and do not care about the outcome of this SIP -- they will
be happy either way.  But, this SIP also acknowledges that of the voters that
_do_ care about the vote outcome, those who vote "no" are financially
disincentivized to do so, because it would render the Stacks blockchain in a
worse-off state.  Therefore, this SIP requires a supermajority of "yes" votes to
activate, since a strong minority of "no" votes would be a strong signal that
something is seriously wrong with this SIP (despite its apparent benefits).

## Changes to Mining

Nodes that run Stacks 2.05 must put `0x05` in the memo field. Block-commit
transactions that do not have a value that is _at least_ `0x05` will be considered invalid.

The purpose of this change is to ensure that in the unlikely event some miners didn't know
about this SIP, they will quickly find out because their blocks will never be
confirmed or recognized by other users and exchanges that have upgraded.
Moreover, the "at least" condition is meant for future compatibility: if there
is ever another SIP that requires miners to signal support for the SIP's
activation via the memo field, then they can do so by putting in a _higher_
value while still remaining able to mine under the current rules.

## Changes to Runtime Costs

This SIP proposes two breaking changes to runtime costs, as well as a new set of
default cost functions (bypassing SIP-006's voting procedure).

### Block Limit

This SIP proposes increasing the block limits
for MARF reads and writes.  This is a breaking change.

Based on the expected performance improvements in the
implementation of the MARF (see [issue #2869](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/issues/2869)) 
this SIP proposes doubling the current limits on blocks:

```rust
pub const BLOCK_LIMIT_MAINNET: ExecutionCost = ExecutionCost {
    write_length: 15_000_000, // roughly 15 mb
    write_count: 15_000,
    read_length: 100_000_000,
    read_count: 15_000,
    runtime: 5_000_000_000,
};
```

### Changes to Static vs. Dynamic Tabulation of Costs

The cost assessment in Clarity for most data-handling functions (e.g.,
`map-get?`) use the static cost of the fetch rather than the dynamic cost. 
This is a breaking change.  For more information, see [issue #2864](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/issues/2864) in the
`stacks-blockchain` repository.

There are two motivating reasons for doing this:

* It makes static analysis of costs easier, because the cost assessed at runtime
  would always use the declared size of the map entry.
* It allows the cost to be assessed before running the operation.

However, these reasons have not been shown to be practical in production.
For (1), static analysis is always going to overestimate anyways, so system
throughput would improve by using the actual runtime overhead instead of the
maximum runtime overhead when assessing storage costs.  For (2),
allowing a single "speculative" evaluation before aborting a block due to cost
overflow is not particularly burdensome to the network: the maximum size of an
overread is a single Clarity value, which takes only 2MB.

The benefit of using dynamic costs, however, could be significant. Many contracts use
patterns where potentially long lists are stored in data maps, but in practice
the stored lists are relatively short.

Because of this, this SIP proposes using a dynamic cost for these assessments.
Specifically, it proposes changes to the inputs of the following
functions' cost functions:

* `var-get`
* `var-set`
* `map-get?`
* `map-set`
* `map-insert`
* `map-delete`
* `concat`
* `nft-mint?`
* `nft-burn?`
* `nft-transfer?`
* `nft-get-owner?`

#### `(var-get var-name) -> value`

The `x` input to the `var-get` cost function should be the length in
bytes of the consensus serialization (see [SIP-005](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-005/sip-005-blocks-and-transactions.md#clarity-value-representation)
for details on this format) of the returned `value`.

#### `(var-set var-name value)`

The `x` input to the `var-get` cost function should be the length in
bytes of the consensus serialization (see [SIP-005](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-005/sip-005-blocks-and-transactions.md#clarity-value-representation)
for details on this format) of the newly stored `value`.

The memory usage of this function should be this same value. The
memory usage of `var-set` remains in effect until the end of the
transaction (data operations remain in memory during the whole
transaction to enable rollbacks and post-conditions).

#### `(map-get? map-name key) -> value`

The `x` input to the `map-get` cost function should be the sum of the
length in bytes of the consensus serialization of the supplied `key`
and the returned `value`.

#### `(map-set map-name key value)`

The `x` input to the `map-set` cost function should be the sum of the
length in bytes of the consensus serialization of the supplied `key` and
`value` arguments.

The memory usage of this function should be this same value. The
memory usage of `map-set` remains in effect until the end of the
transaction (data operations remain in memory during the whole
transaction to enable rollbacks and post-conditions).

#### `(map-insert map-name key value)`

If the insert is successful, the `x` input to the `map-insert` cost
function should be the sum of the length in bytes of the consensus
serialization of the supplied `key` and `value` arguments.

If the insert is unsuccessful, the `x` input to the `map-insert` cost
function should be the length in bytes of the consensus serialization
of just the supplied `key` argument.

The memory usage of this function should be this same `x` value. The
memory usage of `map-insert` remains in effect until the end of the
transaction (data operations remain in memory during the whole
transaction to enable rollbacks and post-conditions).

#### `(map-delete map-name key)`

The `x` input to the `map-delete` cost function should be the length
in bytes of the consensus serialization of the supplied `key`
argument plus the length in bytes of the consensus serialization of
a `none` Clarity value.

The memory usage of this function should be this same `x` value. The
memory usage of `map-delete` remains in effect until the end of the
transaction (data operations remain in memory during the whole
transaction to enable rollbacks and post-conditions).

#### `(concat list-a list-b)`

The `x` input to the `concat` cost function should be the length of
`list-a` plus the length of `list-b`.

#### `(nft-mint? asset-class asset-identifier recipient)`

The `x` input to the `nft-mint?` cost function should be the length in bytes of
the consensus serialization of the supplied `asset-identifier`.

The memory usage of this function should be this new `x` value, plus the size of
a `principal` type.  The memory
usage of `nft-mint?` remains in effect until the end of the transaction (asset
operations remain in memory during the whole transaction to enable rollbacks and
post-conditions).

#### `(nft-burn? asset-class asset-identifier owner)`

The `x` input to the `nft-burn?` cost function should be the length in bytes of
the consensus serialization of the specified `asset-identifier`.

The memory usage of this function should be this new `x` value, plus the size of
a `principal` type.  The memory
usage of `nft-burn?` remains in effect until the end of the transaction (asset
operations remain in memory during the whole transaction to enable rollbacks and
post-conditions).

#### `(nft-transfer? asset-class asset-identifier sender recipient)`

The `x` input to the `nft-transfer?` cost function should be the length in bytes
of the consensus serialization of the specified `asset-identifier`.

The memory usage of this function should be this new `x` value, plus the size of
a `principal` type.  The memory
usage of `nft-transfer?` remains in effect until the end of the transaction (asset
operations remain in memory during the whole transaction to enable rollbacks and
post-conditions).

#### `(nft-get-owner? asset-class asset-identifier)`

The `x` input to the `nft-get-owner?` cost function should be the length in
bytes of the consensus serialization of the specified `asset-identifier`.

### New Default Cost Functions

Based on results from the
[clarity-benchmarking](https://github.com/blockstack/clarity-benchmarking)
project, this SIP proposes new default cost functions. The new costs are supplied in
the form of a new Clarity smart contract in [Appendix A](#appendix-a).

This could have been carried out through a SIP-006 cost voting procedure, but
due to the opportunity costs incurred by STX holders foregoing PoX rewards to
carry this vote out, this SIP instead proposes bypassing the SIP-006 voting
procedure in this one instance and instead using this SIP's activation procedure
to install these new functions.

# Related Work 

On-chain voting for upgrades is not a new concept.  Bitcoin has famously
executed many soft-forks using time-based activation [5], miner voting
thresholds [6], and a combination of both [7].  The voting approach in this SIP
uses both a timeout and a voting threshold to activate, but differs from
Bitcoin's approach in that it empowers Stackers as the instigators of the
upgrade.

We are aware of one other proposal
(distinct from the procedure described in SIP-006) suggested
using a voting contract to determine the block height at which a
network-upgrade, described in detail in [this Github
discussion](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/discussions/2845).
This SIP differs from this proposal in that the burnchain is used to identify
Stackers.

# Backwards Compatibility

This SIP proposes a breaking change.  If this SIP activates, then old miners'
block-commits will no longer be considered valid.  In addition, old nodes will
not accept new blocks as valid if they exceed the Stacks 2.0 block cost limits.
Therefore, all node operators are encouraged to upgrade immediately once SIP 012
transitions to _Activation-in-Progress_ status.

# Activation

The SIP will be considered _Ratified_ once all of the following are true:

* The cost functions in Appendix A are finalized.  This is a precondition for
  advancing the SIP to _Activation-in-Progress_ status.

* A vote deadline block height and activation block height are chosen and added
  to this SIP's text.  This is a pre-condition for advancing this SIP to
_Activation-in-Progress_ status.

* This SIP is advanced to _Activation-in-Progress_ by the respective consideration
  advisory boards.

* The SIP has garnered sufficient support by the vote deadline block height. Voting by
  sending Bitcoin transactions can begin once the SIP text is updated with the
  "yes" / "no" addresses. Voting concludes at least one week prior to the Stacks 2.05
  activation block.

* A new release of Stacks blockchain (available at
  https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/releases) contains the updated
  cost-limits and a mechanism to use the new cost-limits beyond the activation
block height listed in this SIP.  This release is announced by the Stacks
Foundation.

* The activation block height passes on the Bitcoin chain.

## Activation Status

* On November 15, 2021, the authors finalized the choice of the activation
  block to be Bitcoin block 713,000.  This block is expected to be mined at or
around December 6, 2021 at 23:00 UTC.

* The vote deadline block will be backdated to the first Bitcoin block mined
  after November 23, 2021 at 12:00 EST.  The exact block number will be added to
this SIP's text once it is known.

# Reference Implementation

### Determining runtime cost values

The goal of this proposal is to make the total real runtime of a full
block less than 30 seconds. 30 seconds is a short enough period of
time that prospective miners should be able to process a new block
before the next Bitcoin block 95% of the time (`exp( -1/20 ) ~= 95%`).

To determine a new proposed cost for a Clarity function, we executed a
set of benchmarks for each Clarity cost function in the
[clarity-benchmarking](https://github.com/blockstack/clarity-benchmarking)
Github repository. After running these benchmarks, constant factors in
the runtime functions were fitted using linear regression (given a
transform). These benchmarks produced regression fitted functions for
each Clarity cost function, for example:

```
runtime_ns(cost_secp256k1verify) = 8126809.571429
runtime_ns(cost_or) = 2064.4713444648587 * input_len + 91676.397154
```

The runtime block limit in the Stacks network is `5e9` (unitless), and
the goal of this proposal is that this should correspond to 30 seconds
or `3e10` nanoseconds. So, to convert the `runtime_ns` functions into
runtimes for the Stacks network, we have the simple conversion:

```
runtime_stacks = runtime_ns * 5e9 / 3e10ns
```

For running the benchmarks and analysis in the `clarity-benchmarking`
repository, see the [`README.md`](https://github.com/blockstack/clarity-benchmarking/blob/master/README.md)
file in that repository.
