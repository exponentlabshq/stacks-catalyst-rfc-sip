## Abstract

This SIP proposes a new wrapped Bitcoin asset, called sBTC, which would be implemented on Stacks as a SIP-010 token. sBTC enables seamless and secure integration of Bitcoin into the Stacks ecosystem, unlocking decentralized applications and expanding Bitcoin's utility through smart contracts. Stacks today offers a smart contract runtime for Stacks-hosted assets, and the forthcoming Stacks [3.0 release](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-021/sip-021-nakamoto.md) provides lower transaction latency than Bitcoin for Stacks transactions. By providing a robust BTC-wrapping mechanism based on [threshold signatures](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852.pdf), users would be able to lock their real BTC on the Bitcoin chain, instantiate an equal amount of sBTC tokens on Stacks, use these sBTC tokens on Stacks, and eventually redeem them for real BTC at 1:1 parity, minus the cost of the relevant blockchain transaction fees.

This is the first of several SIPs that describe such a system. This SIP describes the threshold signature mechanism and solicits from the ecosystem both a list of signers and the criteria for vetting them. These sBTC signers would be responsible for collectively holding all locked BTC and redeeming sBTC for BTC upon request. Given the high-stakes nature of their work, the authors of this SIP believe that such a wrapped asset can only be made to work in practice if the Stacks ecosystem members can reach broad consensus on how these signers are chosen. Thus, the first sBTC SIP put forth for activation concerns the selection of sBTC signers.

This SIP outlines but does not describe in technical detail the workings of the first sBTC system. A separate SIP will be written to do so if this SIP successfully activates.

## Problem Statement

Bitcoin Script's computational expressiveness is limited, such that developers who want to build non-trivial decentralized applications must first build and maintain non-trivial off-chain services to make up the difference. Namely, because Bitcoin Script programs can neither store nor read arbitrary chain state (up to VM-imposed size limits), applications that maintain state across Bitcoin transactions must not only provide the means of storing it themselves but also somehow make it available to subsequent Bitcoin transactions.

Doing this in an open-membership peer-to-peer setting has been shown to be a difficult task (given the size and complexity of systems like Lightning, Taro, Bisq, and BitVM), which imposes a high barrier to entry for building decentralized applications on Bitcoin. Our key insight is that existing applications built on Bitcoin have built up most of the workings of an L2 blockchain like Stacks, but have done so implicitly within their interior components. This SIP makes this design choice explicit: the act of building non-trivial applications on Bitcoin is the act of building on a Bitcoin L2, and therefore the act of providing a rich programming environment for BTC is the act of implementing a wrapped BTC asset (sBTC) on a Bitcoin L2 with smart contracts. Indeed, this has been realized already with systems like Rootstock's RBTC.

## Proposed Solution

sBTC aims to mitigate Bitcoin’s limitations by combining the capability of the Stacks Blockchain with the reliability and security of Bitcoin. By enabling the secure movement of BTC in and out of the Stacks Blockchain via the sBTC protocol, users can interact with their BTC on Stacks using Clarity smart contracts which will benefit from faster block times than Bitcoin. The protocol is “secure” in that it is operated by a decentralized signer network, removing the risk of a single point of failure and trust in a single custodian. Users can deposit BTC into the protocol, seamlessly transact using sBTC on the Stacks blockchain, and have the freedom to redeem sBTC tokens for the underlying BTC at any time.

### Programmability

[Clarity](https://docs.stacks.co/clarity/overview) is the smart contract language on Stacks, which allows developers to encode essential business logic on a blockchain. Using smart contracts, developers can build more expressive decentralized applications that interact with sBTC, such as DeFi protocols, stablecoins, payments, and many others.

### Fast Blocks

The Stacks Nakamoto Upgrade, proposed in [SIP-021](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-021/sip-021-nakamoto.md#proposed-solution), enables fast blocks where user-submitted transactions will now take on the order of seconds, instead of tens of minutes. Thus, sBTC on Stacks will offer an improvement to Bitcoin’s current transaction times.

The sBTC protocol not only addresses the limitations of Bitcoin's scripting system but also provides a secure and decentralized solution for utilizing Bitcoin in various applications.

## Design

While the first sBTC implementation is under development, the wrapped nature of the sBTC token means that any such system would have the following properties:

- sBTC is a SIP-10 token backed 1:1 by BTC.
- The sBTC peg wallet is maintained by the set of sBTC signers. These signers are responsible for the security and maintenance of the wallet, ensuring that sBTC is redeemable for BTC.
- Bitcoin can be converted into sBTC within 3 Bitcoin blocks, and sBTC can be converted into Bitcoin within 6 Bitcoin blocks. sBTC relies on the forking behavior guaranteed by [SIP-021](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-021/sip-021-nakamoto.md) in order to maintain the peg wallet correctly across forks.

## Specification

Management of the sBTC peg wallet on the Bitcoin blockchain shall be managed by the proposed set of signers through a democratic process, involving the sBTC Signer Set rather than a single custodian. At launch, the sBTC protocol will be maintained by 15 independent entities that make up the sBTC Signer Set and each unique signer is allocated exactly one vote. The system requires at least 70%, or 11 out of 15 signatures, for an sBTC operation to be fulfilled. The eligibility criteria to become an sBTC Signer are determined through the community governance process of ratifying this SIP. For this release, sBTC will not be part of Stacks consensus.

sBTC Signers are responsible for accepting or rejecting all sBTC deposit and withdrawal operations submitted to the network. For a transaction to be fulfilled, at least 70% of the signers need to approve the transaction. This means that the liveness and reliability of the signers is crucial to the success of the protocol. The system is live ("resilient") if at least 70% of the sBTC Signer voting power are online and honest. Then (and only then), deposits and withdrawals happen in a timely manner. The system is safe ("trustworthy") if at least 30% of the sBTC Signer voting power is honest. Then, no theft of funds can occur. Additionally, more details on sBTC deposit and withdrawals are included in the appendix of this SIP. 

While up to 30% of the signers can be offline without a user impact on the functioning of the protocol, it becomes more critical for the rest of the signers to approve sBTC operations because operations necessarily still need to meet 70% of the original signing power. If more than 30% of signers become unavailable, no sBTC operations will be approved until at least 70% come back online and operational. In the event that 30% of signer set goes permanently offline, the BTC in the peg wallet will become locked. While not currently planned for the initial sBTC release, it is possible to add a clawback mechanism that would allow recovering the BTC. To protect users from a liveness failure during deposit, a deposit UTXO shall be made satisfiable by one of two spending conditions: (1) the signer set spends the UTXO, or (2) the user spends the UTXO after a fixed number of Bitcoin blocks have passed. Then, if there is an indefinite liveness failure, users will be able to reclaim their in-flight BTC [3]. 


### sBTC Signer Responsibilities
The sBTC signers play a critical role in the security and operations of the sBTC system. Their responsibilities can be grouped into two categories: tasks mandated by the sBTC protocol and operational best practices to effectively manage the sBTC system.

**Protocol-Mandated Tasks:**
- Signers must accept and process BTC deposit requests.
- They must fulfill BTC withdrawal requests in a timely manner, ensuring accurate execution.
- Signers are responsible for moving BTC to a new UTXO when private keys are rotated.
- Signers must perform UTXO consolidation as BTC is deposited to optimize the number of unspent outputs [1].
- Signers are required to deduct transaction fees from users to fund BTC withdrawal transactions. This includes:
  - Ensuring that the transaction fee is deducted from the user.
  - Setting a minimum sBTC withdrawal amount to cover the estimated transaction fees.
  - Estimating the transaction fee proportionally based on the requested operation [2].
 
**Operational Best Practices:**
- Signers must maintain industry-standard operational security (opsec) around hosts and private data, including private keys.
- They should collectively coordinate to calculate and advertise the fee parameters of the system, including:
  - The minimum sBTC peg-out amount.
  - The STX transaction fee for minting sBTC. This fee is paid by the user and can be sponsored by a 3rd party.

### sBTC Signer Eligibility Criteria

Signers will run the sBTC binary in addition to the core Stacks signer software and must meet certain criteria in order to facilitate the reliable functioning of the sBTC protocol at all times.

The following eligibility criteria will be used to identify the sBTC Signers:

- Does the proposed sBTC signer have a demonstrable operating history which shows their experience and reliability in running blockchain services?
- Has the proposed sBTC signer participated in running a Stacks signer instance on Stacks 2.5 testnet or mainnet, and can they provide metrics showing this (ex: amount of stacks stacked over past several cycles)?
  * Note: The sBTC signer is a Stacks event observer, meaning that the experience of running a Stacks node signer directly translates to running an sBTC signer.
- Does the proposed sBTC signer agree to use reasonable efforts to maintain >99% uptime on the sBTC Signer? 
  * Note: This metric may be self-affirmed if independent verification is not possible, or confirmed by on-chain voting/stacking activity.
- Does the proposed sBTC signer commit to a direct communication channel to be set up with the sBTC core engineers in order to respond to urgent updates within 24 hours?
- Has the signer made contributions to Bitcoin or the Stacks network over the past year that demonstrate their commitment to the growth and success of the network? Examples include, but are not limited to: publishing independent research, marketing, co-authoring a SIP, submitting a Stacks pull request/issue, providing feedback on Stacks core development, or contributing to a Stacks Working Group.
- Does the geographic distribution of the proposed sBTC signer support a diverse and distributed signer set?

The criteria described above will be used to identify sBTC Signers that are able to meet some or all of the responsibilities described in the previous section.

### Selection Process
The sBTC Signer Set will be finalized from the list of eligible Signers, based on the above criteria. The [sBTC Working Group](https://github.com/orgs/stacks-network/discussions/508) will conduct the vetting process and the results will be published as a discussion in the [sBTC Github repository](https://github.com/stacks-network/sbtc/discussions/624). 

The selection process is as follows:
1. **Nomination Phase**: Open a call for nominations within the community.
2. **Evaluation & Community Feedback**: The proposed signer set will be published to provide transparency.
3. **SIP Vote**: The community will vote on the sBTC signer criteria.
4. **Final Selection**:  If SIP-028 is ratified, then the proposed signer set voted upon in step 3 shall be the initial signing set for sBTC. If the signer set changes during the vote, such as by the withdrawal of one or more candidates, then the vote will be restarted in a subsequent reward cycle (to be determined if this comes to pass).

   
### Updating The sBTC Signer Set
In the event that the sBTC Signer Set needs to be updated (for example, if a signer is no longer available to complete their responsibilities) sBTC Signers can perform a threshold vote to agree on the updated set, which would require the same 70% approval threshold as sBTC operations. This process will also be performed if a signer needs to rotate their cryptographic keys.

### [WBTC](https://wbtc.network/assets/wrapped-tokens-whitepaper.pdf)

**WBTC** is a closed membership system made up of 50+ merchants and custodians with keys to the WBTC multisig contract on Ethereum. WBTC deposits and withdrawals can only be performed by the authorized merchants, and end users purchase WBTC directly from the merchants. Until recently, BTC was held in a Bitcoin multi-sig wallet secured solely by BitGo. Now, two of the three multi-sig keys are held by BitGo, while one is held by BiT Global.

### [tBTC v2](https://whitepaper.io/document/691/tbtc-whitepaper)

**tBTC** is an ERC-20 wrapped asset launched in May 2020. BTC is currently held and secured by a permissioned set of 35 Beta Staker Nodes from the Threshold Network. Seven DeFi protocols including Aave and Synthetix manage the minting and burning process, with Guardians monitoring to veto suspicious behavior. tBTC is natively minted on Ethereum and Arbitrum.

### [RBTC](https://rootstock.io/static/a79b27d4889409602174df4710102056/RS-whitepaper.pdf)

**rBTC** is a wrapped BTC asset natively minted on Rootstock, an EVM-compatible sidechain. BTC is secured by a 5-of-9 multi-sig Bitcoin wallet controlled by the Powpeg Federation. Peg operations settle to Bitcoin via merge mining. Instead of collateralizing the system with a new token, peg operators are incentivized by earning a portion of transaction fees. PowPeg operators keep specialized hardware called PowHSMs active and connected to special types of Rootstock full nodes. Since the Bitcoin blockchain and the Rootstock sidechain are not entangled in a single blockchain or in a parent-child relation, peg-in and peg-out transactions require a high number of block confirmations. Peg-ins require 100 Bitcoin blocks, and peg-outs require 4000 Rootstock blocks (roughly 200 Bitcoin Blocks).

The following table summarizes the main design differences between these systems:

| Feature                | WBTC            | tBTC             | rBTC             | sBTC (this SIP)    |
|------------------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Spending threshold      | 2 of 3          | 51 of 100        | 5 of 9           | 11 of 15           |
| Bitcoin finality        | No              | No               | Yes              | Yes                |
| Expected Peg-in speed   | 1 hour          | 1-3 hours        | 16 hours         | 0.5 hours          |
| Expected Peg-out speed  | 1 hour          | 3-5 hours        | 33.3 hours       | 1 hour             |
| Custodian rotation      | No              | Yes              | No               | Yes                |
| Fee structure           | % of BTC moved  | % of BTC moved   | Transaction fees | Transaction fees   |


In conclusion, the sBTC system shares similarities with existing models but introduces some key distinctions:
- **Bitcoin Finality:** sBTC inherits Bitcoin finality from [Stacks 3.0](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/feat/sip-021-nakamoto/sips/sip-021/sip-021-nakamoto.md), which ensures that sBTC transactions receive the same level of security provided by the Bitcoin network.
- **Faster Deposit & Withdrawal Times:** sBTC enables BTC withdrawals without the long delays associated with block confirmations in other systems. This is achieved through the finality rules described in [Stacks 3.0](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/feat/sip-021-nakamoto/sips/sip-021/sip-021-nakamoto.md).


## Activation

sBTC is designed to activate on Stacks 3.0 as defined in [SIP-021](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/feat/sip-021-nakamoto/sips/sip-021/sip-021-nakamoto.md). Therefore, this SIP is only meaningful when SIP-021 activates. The sBTC Working Group plans to observe at least 2-4 weeks of network behavior on Stacks Nakamoto to ensure a stable release. After this period, sBTC can be activated on the Stacks network without requiring a separate hard fork.

### Process of Activation

Users can vote to approve this SIP with either their locked/stacked STX or with unlocked/liquid STX, or both. The SIP voting page can be found at [sbtc.vote](https://sbtc.vote). The criteria for the stacker and non-stacker voting is as follows.

#### For Stackers:

In order for this SIP to activate, the following criteria must be met by the set of Stacked STX:

- At least 80 million Stacked STX must vote, with least 70% (56 million) voting "yes".

The voting addresses will be:

| **Vote** | **Bitcoin Address**              | **Stacks Address**                    | Message      | ASCII-encoded message                      | Bitcoin script                                                                                  |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| yes      | `11111111111mdWK2VXcrA1e7dnvidC` | `SP00000000001WPAWSDEDMQ0B9J72P0KAK2` | `yes-sip-28` | `000000000000000000007965732d7369702d3238` | `OP_DUP` `OP_HASH160` `000000000000000000007965732d7369702d3238` `OP_EQUALVERIFY` `OP_CHECKSIG` |
| no       | `111111111111ACW5wa4RwyeKYEAzMD` | `SP000000000006WVSDEDMQ0B9J73E2TN78`  | `no-sip-28`  | `00000000000000000000006e6f2d7369702d3238` | `OP_DUP` `OP_HASH160` `00000000000000000000006e6f2d7369702d3238` `OP_EQUALVERIFY` `OP_CHECKSIG` |

The addresses have been generated as follows:

- Encode `<message>` in ASCII, with 0-padding.
- Use the resulting `<encoding>` in the Bitcoin script`OP_DUP` `OP_HASH160` `<encoding>` `OP_EQUALVERIFY` `OP_CHECKSIG`.
- The Bitcoin address is the `base58check` of the hash of the Bitcoin script above.
- The Stacks address is the `c32check-encoded` Bitcoin address.

Stackers (pool and solo) vote by sending Stacks dust to the corresponding Stacks address from the account where their Stacks are locked.

Solo stackers only can also vote by sending a bitcoin dust transaction (6000 sats) to the corresponding bitcoin address.

#### For Non-Stackers:

Users with liquid STX can vote on proposals directly at [sBTC.vote](https://sbtc.vote) using the Ecosystem DAO. Liquid STX is the user’s balance, less any STX they have locked in the PoX stacking protocol, at the block height at which the voting started (preventing the same STX from being transferred between accounts and used to effectively double vote). This is referred to generally as "snapshot" voting.

For this SIP to pass, 70% of all liquid STX committed by voting must be in favor of the proposal. 

We believe that these thresholds are sufficient to demonstrate interest from Stackers -- Stacks users who have a long-term interest in the Stacks blockchain's successful operation -- in performing this upgrade.

### Activation Status

At the end of Bitcoin block height 869,749, the following vote was recorded: **A total of 135,940,943 STX participated, with 135,801,729 STX (99.90%) voting 'Yes' and 139,214 STX (0.10%) voting 'No'.**

A breakdown of the vote is as follows:
- For STX locked in stacking, a total of 126,084,232 STX participated. Of this, 125,945,571 STX (99.89%) from 77 accounts voted 'Yes', while 138,661 STX (0.11%) from 1 account voted 'No'.
- For unlocked STX, a total of 9,718,049 STX participated. Of this, 9,717,496 STX (99.99%) from 1,175 accounts voted 'Yes', while 553 STX (0.01%) from 40 accounts voted 'No'.

All voting criteria from STX holders have been met. A breakdown of the transactions can be found [here](https://stx.eco/dao/proposals/SP3JP0N1ZXGASRJ0F7QAHWFPGTVK9T2XNXDB908Z.sip028-signer-criteria-for-sbtc/results2).

### Specification

#### Deposits

The main steps of the sBTC Deposit flow will be as follows:

1. **Deposit request:** A bitcoin holder creates a transaction on Bitcoin.
  - The deposit transaction contains a UTXO (deposit UTXO) spendable by sBTC Signers, with an OP_DROP payload.
  - The payload contains the recipient address of the sBTC and the maximum fee the depositor is willing to have go towards the consolidation of the deposits into a single UTXO.
2. **Proof of deposit:** The bitcoin holder submits a proof of deposit on Stacks by invoking the Deposit API.
3. **Deposit accept:** 
  - **Deposit redeem:** The sBTC Signers redeem the deposit by consuming the deposit UTXO, consolidating it into the sBTC UTXO.
  - **Mint:** The sBTC Signers finalize the deposit acceptance making a Clarity contract call that mints the sBTC on the Stacks Layer.

#### Withdrawals (Redeeming sBTC)

The main steps of the sBTC withdrawal flow are as follows:

1. **Withdrawal request:** An sBTC holder calls the `withdraw-request` function in the `.sbtc` contract.
   - This transfers the requested amount of sBTC to the `.sbtc` contract & mints the user a non-transferable locked-sBTC as a placeholder.
2. **Withdrawal accept:** If accepted, the following happens:
   - The signers create a transaction on Bitcoin which returns the requested amount to the designated address.
   - Once the Bitcoin transaction is confirmed, the signers make a smart contract call to one of the `.sbtc` contracts to mark the transaction as fulfilled.
   - If successful, the resulting Stacks transaction will record the withdrawal request as complete & will accordingly burn the user’s locked-sBTC.
3. **Withdrawal reject:** If instead the request is rejected, the sBTC signers will call the `withdraw-reject` function in the `.sbtc` smart contract. This function does the following:
   - Returns the sBTC to the holder.
   - Records the signer votes.
