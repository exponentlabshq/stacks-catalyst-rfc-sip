# Consideration Advisory Board Template

The template below serves as a starting point for creating a new CAB or updating existing details.

**Inactive CAB**

If a CAB is not active yet, it will have only two sections:

- the main section describing the members
- an about section explaining the placeholder status
- example: [Diversity CAB](diversity.md)

**Active CAB**

If a CAB is active, it starts with the member information section, directly below the CAB title.

## Bylaws

We choose to adopt the bylaws Steering Committee member @jcnelson set out in this doc: https://gist.github.com/jcnelson/3fcc635ede20ce98d1eae60941eb127a

Starting from those bylaws, this CAB will continue to evaluate what works, what doesn't work, and use the feedback and lessons learned to improve the process and increase involvement along the way.
